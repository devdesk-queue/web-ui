This repository will serve as the marketing landing page and secondary page for devdes queue application

## Proposal
Students at lambda school need a place where they can escalate their concerns and receive help. This app allows an admin to manage help desk tickets that come in from Lambda School Students. It also allows students (A 2nd user type) to submit a help desk ticket, categorize it and post it to the help channel.

## Features
As a student, you can log in and have the ability to see tickets that are currently open for help. As a student you will be able to create a new help ticket with a title, description, what you've tried, and a category (i.e. React). 

As a helper, you will be able to login and see a list of open tickets. As a helper you will be able to assign a ticket to yourself by clicking a ""help student"" button. As a helper you will be able to mark the ticket as ""resolved"", or re-assign the ticket back to the queue if you cannot resolve the ticket.

## Future Features
Build an integrated slack-bot that allows students to submit help tickets through slack. Allow the ability to subscribe to the Queue in slack to be notified if someone opens a ticket.

## Target Audience
Our target audience is Lambda School students and staff.
